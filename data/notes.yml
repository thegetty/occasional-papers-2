    note: "It is uncertain what Lemkin would have thought of this application of his concept of cultural genocide. He had long been concerned about minority rights and, as noted above, called in *Axis Rule* for the enhancement of protections for minorities in Europe. Yet A. Dirk Moses quotes Lemkin as making a distinction that would be quite relevant to the debate on preserving indigenous cultures: “Obviously throughout history we have witnessed decline of nations and races. We will meet this phenomenon in the future too, but there is an entirely different situation when nations or races fade away after having exhausted their spiritual and physical energies, and there is a different contingency when they are murdered on the highway of world history. Dying of age or disease is a disaster but genocide is a crime.” Moses, “Raphael Lemkin, Culture, and the Concept of Genocide,” 28."
